## Weather Recommendations

The app provides smart recommendations based on weather conditions:

- **Hot (>30Â°C)**: "Bring a hat and water for your child"
- **Rainy**: "Don't forget an umbrella and raincoat"
- **Thunderstorm**: "Keep your child indoors if possible"
- **Cold**: "Dress your child warmly"

## Usage

Once set up, the weather will automatically:
1. Request location permission
2. Fetch current weather for your location
3. Display weather info with recommendations
4. Allow manual refresh with the refresh button

## Free Tier Limits

OpenWeather free tier includes:
- 1,000 API calls per day
- Current weather data
- 5-day forecast (if needed later)

This is more than enough for a personal app that checks weather a few times per day.
